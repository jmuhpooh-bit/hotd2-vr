rem Build this Flycast fork for Windows x64 with MSVC + Ninja (same recipe as Flycast's CI),
rem for PCVR (OpenXR: SteamVR, Quest Link, Virtual Desktop), the finger-gun mode and testing.
rem Usage: build-win.cmd [Release|RelWithDebInfo|Debug]
rem Needs Visual Studio 2022 (or its Build Tools) with the C++ workload, found with vswhere.
rem The CMake and Ninja that come with it are called by full path, so another CMake earlier
rem in PATH (devkitPro's msys2 one, say) can't get in the way: it cannot drive MSVC.
